#### Use h4 head for each section

Write the post in markdown. You may have a look at this [excellent markdown guide from Github](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to get yourself familiar with markdown.

However, if you want to add a picture, use the following:

{% include image.html url="/learn/assets/post/1970-1-1-your-name-sample/testing.jpg" description="The caption of the picture" %}
