To test the blog locally, you need to install **bundle** and **Jekyll**. You may refer to [the official tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements) from Jekyll to install the software properly. Once it's done, simply go to the directory of the cloned repository, and start the Jekyll server by entering:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

After starting the server on your local machine, you can open a browser and visit [http://localhost:4000/learn/](http://localhost:4000/learn/).
